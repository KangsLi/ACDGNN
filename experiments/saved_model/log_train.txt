From /DWM/My Drive/GBNNDDI/DSRADDI5/myutils/dsraddi_func.py:51: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
From /DWM/My Drive/GBNNDDI/DSRADDI5/myutils/dsraddi_func.py:70: conv1d (from tensorflow.python.layers.convolutional) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.keras.layers.Conv1D` instead.
From /tensorflow-1.15.2/python3.7/tensorflow_core/python/layers/convolutional.py:218: Layer.apply (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.base_layer) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `layer.__call__` method instead.

From /DWM/My Drive/GBNNDDI/DSRADDI5/myutils/dsraddi_func.py:268: calling l2_normalize (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_impl) with dim is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
dim is deprecated, use axis instead
From /tensorflow-1.15.2/python3.7/tensorflow_core/python/ops/nn_impl.py:183: where (from tensorflow.python.ops.array_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
From DSRADDI.py:407: The name tf.train.AdamOptimizer is deprecated. Please use tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer instead.

From DSRADDI.py:432: The name tf.global_variables_initializer is deprecated. Please use tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer instead.
